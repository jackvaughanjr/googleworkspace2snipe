# googleworkspace2snipe

Syncs Google Workspace license assignments into [Snipe-IT](https://snipeit.com/).
Each Google Workspace SKU (subscription) is created as a **separate Snipe-IT
license** — for example, "Google Workspace Business Plus", "Google Voice Standard",
and "AI Ultra Access" each become their own license entry with per-user seat
assignments.

Users are automatically checked out to the licenses they hold in Google Workspace
and checked back in when a license is removed or a user is suspended.

Authentication uses a Google Cloud service account with
[domain-wide delegation](https://support.google.com/a/answer/162106) — no user
interaction required. Runs fully headless; suitable for cron or similar schedulers.

---

## Requirements

- A Google Cloud project with the **Enterprise License Manager API** enabled
- A service account with domain-wide delegation granted in the Google Admin Console
- A Snipe-IT instance with an API key that has license management permissions

---

## Google Cloud setup

1. **Enable the Enterprise License Manager API** (APIs & Services → Library →
   "Enterprise License Manager API").

2. **Create a service account** (IAM & Admin → Service Accounts → Create). No Cloud
   IAM roles are required. After creating it, go to Keys → Add Key → Create New Key
   → JSON and download the key file.

3. **Grant domain-wide delegation** in the [Google Admin Console](https://admin.google.com):
   - Security → Access and data control → API controls → Manage Domain Wide Delegation
     → Add new
   - **Client ID**: the service account's numeric Client ID (the `client_id` field in
     the JSON key)
   - **OAuth Scopes**: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/apps.licensing`

4. **Choose an admin email**: any Google Workspace super admin address in your domain.
   This is the account the service account will impersonate.

## Installation

**Download a pre-built binary** from the [latest release](https://github.com/jackvaughanjr/googleworkspace2snipe/releases/latest):

```sh
# macOS (Apple Silicon)
curl -L https://github.com/jackvaughanjr/googleworkspace2snipe/releases/latest/download/googleworkspace2snipe-darwin-arm64 -o googleworkspace2snipe
chmod +x googleworkspace2snipe

# Linux (amd64)
curl -L https://github.com/jackvaughanjr/googleworkspace2snipe/releases/latest/download/googleworkspace2snipe-linux-amd64 -o googleworkspace2snipe
chmod +x googleworkspace2snipe

# Linux (arm64)
curl -L https://github.com/jackvaughanjr/googleworkspace2snipe/releases/latest/download/googleworkspace2snipe-linux-arm64 -o googleworkspace2snipe
chmod +x googleworkspace2snipe
```

Or build from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jackvaughanjr/googleworkspace2snipe
cd googleworkspace2snipe
go build -o googleworkspace2snipe .
```

---

## Configuration

Copy `settings.example.yaml` to `settings.yaml` and fill in your values:

```sh
cp settings.example.yaml settings.yaml
$EDITOR settings.yaml
```

`settings.yaml` is gitignored and should never be committed.

### Minimal configuration

```yaml
google_workspace:
  credentials_file: "path/to/service-account.json"
  admin_email: "admin@your-domain.example.com"
  domain: "your-domain.example.com"

snipe_it:
  url: "https://your-snipe-it-instance.example.com"
  api_key: "your-snipe-it-api-key"
  license_category_id: 42   # required; find in Admin → Categories
```

### License naming (prefix / suffix)

By default, Snipe-IT license names match the Google SKU name exactly:

```
Google Workspace Business Plus
Google Voice Standard
```

Use `license_name_prefix` and/or `license_name_suffix` to customize:

```yaml
google_workspace:
  license_name_prefix: ""               # e.g. "Acme - "
  license_name_suffix: " (acme.com)"    # e.g. for multi-tenant disambiguation
```

This produces:

```
Google Workspace Business Plus (acme.com)
Google Voice Standard (acme.com)
```

The prefix and suffix are concatenated verbatim — include any desired separators
(spaces, dashes, parentheses) in the values themselves.

### Product IDs

By default, the following product families are queried:

- `Google-Apps` — Business / Enterprise / Education plans
- `Google-Vault` — Google Vault
- `Google-Drive-storage` — Additional storage
- `Cloud-Identity` — Cloud Identity
- `Google-Voice` — Google Voice

To add products not in this default list (such as newer add-ons):

```yaml
google_workspace:
  product_ids:
    - "Google-Apps"
    - "Google-Vault"
    - "Google-Drive-storage"
    - "Cloud-Identity"
    - "Google-Voice"
    - "YOUR-ADDON-PRODUCT-ID"   # add extras here
```

Only SKUs with at least one active assignment produce a Snipe-IT license.

### Environment variable overrides

| Env var                   | Config key                          |

## Usage

### Validate connections

```sh
./googleworkspace2snipe test
```

Lists all Google Workspace SKUs with active assignments and shows whether the
corresponding Snipe-IT license already exists:

```
=== Google Workspace ===
Domain:   acme.com
Products: [Google-Apps Google-Vault ...]

=== SKUs → Snipe-IT Licenses ===
Snipe-IT License Name                               Users  Snipe-IT Status
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Google Voice Standard                                   3  id=42 seats=3 free=0
Google Workspace Business Plus                         67  id=38 seats=70 free=3
```

### Run a sync

```sh
# Dry run — see what would change without making any changes
./googleworkspace2snipe sync --dry-run

# Real sync
./googleworkspace2snipe sync

# Sync all licenses for a single user
./googleworkspace2snipe sync --email user@your-domain.example.com

# Force re-sync of all seat notes (even if unchanged)
./googleworkspace2snipe sync --force
```

### Global flags

| Flag              | Description                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `--config PATH`   | Path to config file (default: settings.yaml)|
| `-v, --verbose`   | INFO-level logging                          |
| `-d, --debug`     | DEBUG-level logging                         |
| `--log-file PATH` | Append logs to a file                       |
| `--log-format`    | `text` (default) or `json`                  |
| `--version`       | Print version and exit                      |

## Snipe-IT seat notes

Each seat's `notes` field contains stable identifiers for debugging:

```
product_id: Google-Apps
sku_id: 1010020025
```

These values are written once on checkout and do not change, so subsequent syncs
show seats as `skipped`. Use `--force` to rewrite all notes.

---

## Slack notifications

Set `slack.webhook_url` in `settings.yaml` (or `SLACK_WEBHOOK` env var) to
receive notifications for:

- Sync failures
- Google Workspace users with no matching Snipe-IT account (deduplicated — one
  message per user even if they hold multiple licenses)
- Sync completion summaries

All notifications are suppressed in `--dry-run` mode.

---

## Releases

Releases are built automatically by GitHub Actions on `v*` tag push:

```sh
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

Four platform binaries are attached to each release:
`darwin-arm64`, `linux-amd64`, `linux-arm64`, `windows-amd64.exe`.
